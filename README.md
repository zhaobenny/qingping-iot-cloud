# Qingping IoT (cloud)

Library for accessing cloud service of Qingping IoT (instead of Bluetooth).

## Background

This is designed for users who:

- have Qingping IoT supported devices
  - see [docs](https://developer.qingping.co/cloud-to-cloud/specification-guidelines#2-products-list-and-support-note) for full list
  - boils down to ones with native Wi-Fi and selected BT-only via Qingping gateway
- do not want to use Bluetooth to poll devices directly
  - at least 2nd generation of Qingping Air Monitor does not have BT at all
  - for larger houses and offices it's problematic to set up several non-Qingping BT gateways
- do not want to "privatize" devices
  - said operation eliminates access from Qingping IoT mobile app and ability to upgrade firmware
  - it requires local MQTT server and all responsibility is shifted on user

This library is mainly created for use with Home Assistant integration (not yet implemented), but also offers CLI.

The scope of APIs implemented is shown in [API.md](./API.md).

## How to get credentials

Normal users have static *App Key* and *App Secret* tied to their account. 

1. register on [qingpingiot.com](https://www.qingpingiot.com)
2. download mobile app linked there
3. bind devices in app
4. go back to [qingpingiot.com](https://www.qingpingiot.com/devices) and validate that you see all the devices
5. log in to [developer.qingping.co](https://developer.qingping.co/personal/permissionApply) using the same credentials as for the app
6. go to [Access Management](https://developer.qingping.co/personal/permissionApply) and get credentials
